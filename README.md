# Naljepnice - Sticky labels, print utility
Sticky labels print utility

This util is for printing stickers on the A4 paper (like 5 column by 25 rows, something like that).
You can even design your layout.

Part with the barcode require BDE, sorry.

Background: this was for my client who requested automated label printing for the purpose of labeling their video rental store.

PS: 
- this is old project made with Delphi
- it won't work without BDE installed
- don't ask for VCLs
